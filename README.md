# LLD-Learners
This repository is used to maintain solution of low level design problems.

##Points to be kept in mind when starting any solution

1. Always include a getAll in repositories
2. Declare(try to) exceptions before hand
3. always try to implement find by primary or candidate keys
4. Always try to send objects as parameters to methods instead of multiple variables (e.g string, int)
5. since we are working in User or Vehicle class, then method name should be register instead of registerUser or registerVehicle
