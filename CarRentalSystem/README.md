# Design a Car Rental System
Let's design a car rental system where customers can rent vehicles.

A Car Rental System is a software built to handle the renting of automobiles for a short period of time, generally ranging from a few hours to a few weeks. A car rental system often has numerous local branches (to allow its user to return a vehicle to a different location), and primarily located near airports or busy city areas.

## System Requirements
We will focus on the following set of requirements while designing our Car Rental System:

1. The system will support the renting of different automobiles like cars, trucks, SUVs, vans, and motorcycles. 
2. The system should be able to retrieve information like which member took a particular vehicle or what vehicles have been rented out by a specific member. 
3. The system should collect a late-fee for vehicles returned after the due date. 
4. Members should be able to search the vehicle inventory and reserve any available vehicle. 
5. Members should be able to cancel their reservations.
